(WIP)
A script to automatically find resistors from digikey with values given by a kicad schematic, and populate their price and MPN and Digikey part number

forked from https://gist.github.com/colinoflynn/8e9747eaa9f3f97e29be65316460f038, which does something similar for altium

if I can get this to work I'll add support for capacitors and stuff too
There's eventually gonna be a config file where you can set minimum in-stock quantities, cut tape/reel preference, etc

Cheers,
Ben
